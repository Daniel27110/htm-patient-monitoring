  \justifying The effective monitoring of critically ill pediatric patients in intensive care units (ICUs) is a labor-intensive process that demands meticulous analysis to assess each patient's condition. This work explores the use of machine learning models for predictive analytics to identify early warning signs of clinical deterioration. By integrating real-time data from patient monitoring devices, the proposed system aims to support medical decision-making by generating alerts indicative of potential physiological instability. The methodology involves data acquisition, preprocessing, model development, and validation in a clinical setting. The results demonstrate the potential of predictive analytics to improve patient outcomes by enabling proactive medical interventions.
